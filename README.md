# Data Viewer

Placeholder repository for a project to visualize JavaScript data structures in table layout, similar to [console.table()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/table) but for nested structures and rich objects.

### foeGameDataViewer

Original script for visualization of game data for an online game [Forge of Empires](http://forgeofempires.com) which inspired this little project.

### riot

Test of how easy it is to work with the [riot](https://muut.com/riotjs/) library.
