### Data Viewer

Placeholder repository for a project to visualize JavaScript data structures in table, similar to [console.table()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/table) but for nested structures.

Inspired by foeGameDataViewer for visualization of game data for and online game [Forge of Empires](forgeofempires.com).
